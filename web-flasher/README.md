## Web flasher

Static page for flashing the birdnet-esp32-rtsp-mic firmware (BirdNET-Go / BirdNET-Pi, Seeed XIAO
ESP32-C3/S3/C5/C6) directly from the browser with ESP Web Tools.

Current prepared images: **firmware 1.10.1** (2026-06-25).

ESP Web Tools automatically selects the `ESP32-C3`, `ESP32-S3`, `ESP32-C5`, or `ESP32-C6` manifest
entry based on the connected chip. It cannot distinguish between different boards with the same chip
family, so the manifest is intended for Seeed XIAO boards with these chips.

Note for 1.10.1: the images include XIAO ESP32-C3, XIAO ESP32-S3, XIAO ESP32-C5, and
XIAO ESP32-C6 builds. OTA update endpoints require the Web UI mutation header and reject merged USB
firmware images.

Note for 1.10.0: the images add XIAO ESP32-C3, XIAO ESP32-S3, and XIAO ESP32-C5 alongside the
original XIAO ESP32-C6. The physical microphone wiring is the same by XIAO pin labels
`D3`/`D1`/`D2`, but the GPIO numbers differ between chips.

Note for 1.9.3: the image includes added RTSP/UDP compatibility for BirdNET-Pi
(`RTP-Info`, `source`/`ssrc`, and RTCP port handling). It was verified against a clean
`Nachtzuster/BirdNET-Pi` installation with the `/audio2` stream in BirdNET-Pi/UDP mode.

Default public builds:
- include separate firmware for XIAO ESP32-C3, XIAO ESP32-S3, XIAO ESP32-C5, and XIAO ESP32-C6,
- enable the external antenna on the C6 build through the GPIO3/GPIO14 RF switch,
- do not use firmware GPIO antenna switching on the C3/S3/C5 builds,
- do not have an OTA password set,
- belong only on a trusted local network.

Firmware 1.9.2 and newer includes an Arduino IDE build-size fix: the
`esp32-birdnet-mic/build_opt.h` file disables unused C++ exception/unwind metadata and keeps the
tight default 1.2 MB app partition on XIAO ESP32-C3/C6 below the limit without removing features.

The firmware is intended for the **ICS-43434** I2S microphone as the reference/tested option.
The **INMP441** microphone was user-confirmed as compatible without firmware changes when using the
same I2S wiring on the same physical XIAO pins (`SCK` -> D3, `WS` -> D1, `SD` -> D2); see:

### Structure
- `index.html` - main page with the "Flash" button and instructions.
- `manifest.json` - ESP Web Tools manifest, writes only firmware parts without NVS and includes C3/S3/C5/C6 builds.
- `bootloader-<board>.bin`, `partitions-<board>.bin`, `boot_app0-<board>.bin` - system parts for USB web flashing.
- `firmware-<board>.bin` - merged image (bootloader + partition + app), only for manual full flash.
- `firmware-app-<board>.bin` - app-only image for OTA update through the device Web UI.
- `bootloader.bin`, `partitions.bin`, `boot_app0.bin`, `firmware.bin`, `firmware-app.bin` - compatible C6 aliases.
- `ota-version.txt` - simple text file with the OTA build version.

The manifest intentionally does not use the merged `firmware.bin` at offset `0x0`, because during an
update it would overwrite the NVS area from `0x9000` with `0xff` bytes and erase Wi-Fi and application
settings. ESP Web Tools also treats flashing an unrecognized device as a new installation and erases
the whole flash by default. Because of that, `new_install_prompt_erase` is enabled in the manifest;
when updating, choose to keep existing data.

### OTA update without USB
1. Open **https://esp32mic.msmeteo.cz**.
2. In the **OTA update without USB** section, enter the device IP address, for example `192.168.1.80`.
3. Click **Open OTA update**.
4. On the device page, choose one option:
   - **Automatic update**: the device downloads the latest board-specific app-only firmware from the web.
   - **Upload compiled file**: manually select an app-only `.bin` file.

Automatic download uses a plain HTTP URL based on the board profile, with the firmware version
directly in the file name, for example `http://esp32mic.msmeteo.cz/firmware-app-c3-1.10.1.bin`. The
server must serve these files over plain HTTP without redirecting to HTTPS. HTTPS/TLS does not fit in
the tight default XIAO ESP32-C3/C6 partitions. `firmware-app.bin` remains a C6-compatible alias for
older firmware.

Do not upload `firmware-<board>.bin` or `firmware.bin` on the OTA page. Those are USB merged images.
For OTA, use `firmware-app-<board>.bin`; `firmware-app.bin` is the compatible C6 alias.

### How to prepare firmware-<board>.bin
Generate a merged image, for example:
```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32c6 merge_bin \
  -o firmware-c6.bin \
  0x0 bootloader.bin \
  0x8000 partitions.bin \
  0x10000 firmware-app-c6.bin
```
Or use the output from `idf.py build` / `arduino-esp32` if it produces the merged bin directly.

### Web deployment

1. Put `index.html`, `manifest.json`, all `bootloader*.bin`, `partitions*.bin`,
   `boot_app0*.bin`, `firmware*.bin`, `firmware-app*.bin`, and `ota-version.txt` in the
   static HTTPS hosting root.
2. Make sure the MIME types for `.json` and `.bin` are correct (`application/json`, `application/octet-stream`).
3. Open the page in Chrome/Edge (desktop), allow serial port access, and click "Flash".

### GitHub release
The version is taken from `web-flasher/manifest.json`; the release should include the flasher/OTA
artifacts from this folder.

### Notes
- WebSerial works only in desktop Chrome/Edge (not Safari, not Firefox).
- The page must run over HTTPS (or `http://localhost` for local testing).
